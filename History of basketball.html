<p>At first, Naismith nailed two baskets to the railings of the gym's inside-the-gym podium, 3.04 meters (about 10 yards) above the ground, using football as a game tool and throwing them at the basket. One point is scored on the shot, which determines the win or loss according to the number of points scored. After each shot, climb a ladder to remove the ball and start playing again. Later gradually change the bamboo basket to a live bottom of the iron basket, and then change to the iron ring under the hanging net. The game was called "Naismith Ball" or "Basket Ball" and was named "Basketball" after repeated consultations with his colleagues for a long time.</p>

<h3>The history</h3>
<div class="o"<p>In early December 1891, the International Training School of the YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts (later Springfield College), was invented by the school's physical education teacher, Dr. James Naismith. In that year, there were only 13 rules of basketball. Dr. Naismith died in 1939 at the age of 78.</p></div>
